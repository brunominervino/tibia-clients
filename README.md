## Installation

1. Download [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist tibiasolutions/tibia-clients [app_name]`.

If Composer is installed globally, run
```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist tibiasolutions/tibia-clients [app_name]
```

You should now be able to visit the path to where you installed the app and see the default home page.

## Update

Since this skeleton is a starting point for your application and various files would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide automated upgrades, so you have to do any updates manually.

## Configuration

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the `'Datasources'` and any other
configuration relevant for your application.
